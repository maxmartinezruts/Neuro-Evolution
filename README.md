# Neuro-Evolution
Neuroevolution techniques have been successfully applied in many reinforcement learning tasks.  Thisstudy  aims  at  determining  whether  a  neuroevolution  method  can  be  used  to  achieve  a  stable  triple-integrator vehicle control system with the presence of a disturbing force.  Control vehicles involving morethan one integration layer are known for being very unstable and difficult to control in the presence ofdisturbance.  Therefore a need to generate an artificial controller is originated.  This study contains adescription of the experiment conducted, followed by an explanation of how genetic algorithms and artifi-cial neural networks are implemented to construct neuroevolution methods.  Subsequently, the product ofthe experiment is discussed by analyzing the results and different experiments are executed using variousparameters to analyze the effectiveness of crossover and mutation.
